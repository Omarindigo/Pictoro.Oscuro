# Pictoro.Oscuro
"Pictoro.Oscuro" is a digital portfolio that showcases my work in both digital and analog photography.

This platform serves as a live, self-managed digital workbook, designed with a minimalist approach to ensure that the focus remains on the photographs themselves.

The collection is thoughtfully organized into three categories: portraits, environments, and abstracts. Each section provides a comprehensive view of my photographic vision and technique.

The web application begins with an interactive splash page, inspired by the aesthetics of the darkroom and the tools of traditional photography. Key visual elements include a central "medallion" design, evocative of a film carrier, a typographic logo that illuminates like darkroom safelights, and the motto "Ligo Lux ad Umbras" ("I bind light to shadows").

The project's name, "Pictoro.Oscuro," is a blend of Latin and Spanish influences. "Pictoro" comes from the Latin root for artist and references the Picatrix, hinting at esoteric themes. "Oscuro," the Spanish word for dark, subtly nods to the camera obscura, paying homage to the historical foundations of photography.
